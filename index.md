## Abstract

Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we leverage a large-scale pre-trained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various applications Short abstract of the paper. Explain the problem, method, and results in a few sentences.
